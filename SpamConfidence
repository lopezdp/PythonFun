#Write a program that prompts for a file name,
#then opens that file and reads through the file,
#looking for lines of the form:

#X-DSPAM-Confidence:    0.8475

#Count these lines and extract the floating point values
#from each of the lines and compute the average of those values
#and produce an output as shown below.
#Do not use the sum() function or a variable named sum in your solution.
#You can download the sample data at

#http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/mbox-short.txt

#when you are testing below enter mbox-short.txt as the file name
